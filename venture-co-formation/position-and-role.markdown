# Position & Role

This page defines how participation is framed within the Venture Co-Formation channel.

Its purpose is not persuasion.  
Its purpose is alignment.

---

## Role Within This Channel

Within Venture Co-Formation, participation is defined by **architectural authority and system authorship**.

The role taken here is:
- architectural co-former  
- system author  
- technical authority  
- long-term coherence steward  

This role exists at the **foundational layer** of a venture, not at the executional or advisory layer.

Architectural decisions made at this stage are:
- difficult to reverse  
- structurally binding  
- long-lived in consequence  

They therefore require protected authority and appropriate ownership.

---

## What This Role Is Not

To avoid mis-framing, this role is **explicitly not**:

- a general technical helper  
- an unpaid advisor  
- a sounding board for undeveloped ideas  
- an implementation resource  
- a temporary CTO without authority  
- a replacement for missing capability without reciprocal value  

Requests framed as:
- “just a quick sense-check”
- “help us think it through”
- “initial guidance before we formalise”
- “we will sort equity later”

are not compatible with this channel.

---

## Authority, Not Support

This channel is not built around support or assistance.

It is built around **non-substitutable contribution**.

Architectural judgement here:
- shapes what is possible and what is not  
- constrains future execution paths  
- determines long-term scalability and risk  
- creates or destroys optionality  

As a result:
- authority must be explicit  
- responsibility must be recognised  
- ownership must reflect irreversibility  

Equality of effort does not imply equality of ownership.

---

## Dependency as the Entry Condition

This channel only functions where **mutual dependency** exists.

Examples include situations where:
- a venture cannot legally operate without a specific licence or authority  
- a system cannot exist without coherent architectural authorship  
- market access or distribution is non-replicable  
- regulatory, technical, or structural constraints dominate  

If one party could realistically proceed alone by hiring, outsourcing, or advising around the gap, co-formation is not appropriate.

---

## Long-Term Orientation

Participation here assumes:
- long-term responsibility  
- consequence-aware decision making  
- tolerance for asymmetry  
- protection of intellectual position  

Short-term optimisation, speed-first execution, or reversible experimentation are misaligned with this role.

---

## Clarity Over Comfort

This page exists to prevent future friction.

If this framing feels:
- overly rigid  
- unnecessarily formal  
- too restrictive  
- misaligned with how you prefer to work  

then this channel is not a fit.

That outcome is intentional.
