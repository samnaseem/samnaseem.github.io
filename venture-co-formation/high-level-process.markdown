# Process (High-Level Only)

This page outlines the **shape** of interaction within Venture Co-Formation.

It does not describe content, detail, or substance.  
It exists to reduce uncertainty, not to promise outcomes.

---

## Overview

Venture Co-Formation follows a deliberate, consequence-aware process.

Progression is:
- conditional  
- time-bounded  
- non-iterative by default  

Continuation is never assumed.

---

## 1. Protected Introduction

Engagement begins only after a **pre-engagement agreement** is in place.

This establishes:
- protection of intellectual contribution  
- ownership boundaries  
- expectations of conduct  
- clarity on permitted use  

No architectural or system-level discussion occurs before this step.

---

## 2. Initial Framing

Once protected, a limited framing interaction may occur.

This may include:
- clarification of the venture’s shape  
- surfacing of structural assumptions  
- identification of constraints and dependencies  
- early recognition of asymmetry or misalignment  

This phase is:
- tightly scoped  
- time-bounded  
- consequence-aware  

It is not exploratory by default.

---

## 3. Structural Assessment

Following initial framing, a determination is made.

This assessment considers:
- feasibility across domains  
- irreversibility of key decisions  
- alignment of authority and responsibility  
- long-term risk distribution  
- viability of co-formation as a mechanism  

Most engagements end at this stage.

---

## 4. Decision Point

A clear decision is reached:

- proceed to formal co-formation  
- or disengage  

There is no partial continuation.

Disengagement preserves intellectual protection and carries no negative judgement.

---

## 5. Formalisation (If Proceeding)

If co-formation proceeds, formalisation may include:
- definition of roles and authority  
- equity or economic participation  
- governance structure  
- licensing or ownership arrangements  

Formalisation reflects:
- long-term responsibility  
- irreversibility  
- non-substitutable contribution  

---

## No Iterative Drift

This process does not support:
- repeated reframing  
- rolling discovery  
- indefinite evaluation  
- open-ended discussion  

If clarity cannot be reached, disengagement is the correct outcome.

---

## Next

If this process aligns with how you expect a venture to be formed, continue.
