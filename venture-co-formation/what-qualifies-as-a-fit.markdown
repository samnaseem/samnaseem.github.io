# What Qualifies as a Fit

This page exists to determine whether Venture Co-Formation is structurally appropriate **before** any interaction occurs.

It is not an evaluation of idea quality.  
It is an evaluation of **dependency, authority, and irreversibility**.

---

## Required Conditions

Venture Co-Formation may be appropriate only if **all** of the following are true:

- The venture cannot proceed in a meaningful way without complementary authority  
- Each party brings something **non-substitutable** to the formation of the venture  
- The absence of either party materially increases risk or limits viability  
- Architectural decisions made early will have long-lived consequences  
- Informal collaboration would expose intellectual contribution or create ambiguity  

If any of these conditions are not met, co-formation is not the correct mechanism.

---

## Examples of Complementary Authority

The following are illustrative, not exhaustive:

- regulated or licensed access that cannot be delegated or hired around  
- domain authority that materially affects feasibility or credibility  
- non-replicable distribution or market position  
- architectural or system authorship that defines the venture’s core capability  
- structural control over capital, assets, or governance  

Complementary authority is defined by **dependency**, not by effort or enthusiasm.

---

## Common Non-Fits

This channel is **not appropriate** for situations where:

- the gap could be filled by hiring, outsourcing, or consulting  
- architectural authority is treated as advisory rather than foundational  
- the primary need is validation, feedback, or confidence  
- roles and ownership are expected to be negotiated later  
- experimentation is favoured over consequence-aware formation  
- the venture can proceed independently with minor inconvenience  

These are not failures.  
They are simply different modes of work.

---

## Idea Quality Is Not the Filter

Strong ideas are frequently rejected here.  
Weak ideas occasionally proceed.

The determining factor is not novelty, market size, or ambition.

The determining factor is whether **co-formation is structurally necessary**.

---

## Authority Mismatch as a Failure Mode

This channel fails when:
- one party carries irreversible risk without authority  
- contribution is exposed before protection exists  
- ownership is disconnected from long-term responsibility  
- architectural decisions are made without stewardship  

If these risks are present, the correct outcome is non-participation.

---

## Self-Selection Is Expected

Most readers should decide this channel is not appropriate for them.

That outcome is not accidental.

If you are unsure whether this is a fit, it usually is not.

If you believe the conditions above genuinely apply, continue.
