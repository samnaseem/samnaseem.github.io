# Boundaries & Non-Negotiables

This page defines the absolute constraints governing Venture Co-Formation.

They are not starting points for discussion.  
They are the conditions under which discussion is allowed.

---

## Protection Is Mandatory

No architectural discussion, system design, or feasibility exploration occurs without a **pre-engagement agreement** in place.

This requirement is non-negotiable.

Until protection exists:
- no concepts are evaluated  
- no systems are framed  
- no assumptions are explored  
- no feasibility is assessed  

Conversation without protection is considered exposure.

---

## Intellectual Property Principles

The following principles apply at all times:

- architectural concepts remain protected unless explicitly assigned  
- derivative works are governed by agreement  
- no implied licence exists through conversation  
- silence does not imply consent  
- withdrawal preserves intellectual property protection  

These principles apply regardless of whether a venture proceeds.

---

## No Informal Engagement

The following are explicitly out of scope:

- “just helping you think”  
- informal whiteboarding  
- exploratory calls without consequence  
- unpaid discovery or validation  
- parallel use of ideas outside this channel  

If protection is bypassed at any point, activity stops immediately.

---

## No Obligation to Proceed

Participation in this channel creates:
- no commitment to form a venture  
- no obligation to continue discussion  
- no expectation of further involvement  

Declining to proceed is considered a valid and successful outcome.

---

## Authority and Ownership Alignment

The following constraints are absolute:

- no dilution of architectural authority without compensation  
- no assumption of execution without governance position  
- no separation of long-term risk from decision-making authority  
- no retroactive negotiation of ownership  

Equality of effort does not imply equality of ownership.

---

## Time and Scope Constraints

Exploration within this channel is:
- time-bounded  
- consequence-aware  
- non-iterative by default  

Repeated exploration without commitment is not supported.

---

## Structural Integrity Over Rescue

This channel does not exist to:
- rescue structurally unsound ventures  
- compensate for missing fundamentals  
- absorb risk without authority  
- correct misaligned founding decisions  

If structural integrity cannot be achieved, disengagement is the correct outcome.

---

## Enforcement

These boundaries are enforced consistently.

If any boundary is challenged, activity pauses until alignment is restored or engagement ends.

This is not adversarial.  
It is protective.

---

## Next

If these boundaries are acceptable, continue.
