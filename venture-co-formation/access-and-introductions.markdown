# Access & Introductions

This channel does not accept public submissions.

There is no application process, contact form, or open intake.

---

## How Access Occurs

Access to Venture Co-Formation occurs only through:
- trusted personal relationships  
- professional peers  
- regulated or licensed professionals  
- high-trust, context-aware introductions  

Introductions are expected to carry context.

Cold outreach is declined by default.

---

## What an Introduction Represents

An introduction into this channel signals that:
- complementary authority may exist  
- structural dependency is plausible  
- boundaries are understood in advance  
- protection is expected, not resisted  

An introduction is not a request for time.  
It is a request for consideration.

---

## No Alternative Entry Points

This channel is not accessible via:
- referrals without context  
- speculative emails  
- social media messages  
- indirect requests through service channels  

Redirecting into other modes of work to gain access is not supported.

---

## Silence Is Intentional

A lack of response should be interpreted as:
- a boundary, not a judgement  
- a signal of non-alignment  
- a valid outcome  

Persistence does not improve the outcome.

---

## Relationship to Other Work

Venture Co-Formation is intentionally isolated from:
- advisory or consulting work  
- delivery or execution services  
- assessment or feedback mechanisms  

This separation preserves clarity and prevents mis-framing.

---

## Closing

This channel exists to enable a small number of ventures that **could not otherwise exist**.

If you reach this point and choose to disengage, nothing further is required.

Protection enables collaboration.  
Boundaries enable trust.
