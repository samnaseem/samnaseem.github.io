<h2>Clarifying intent before committing to solutions</h2>
<p>Most technology initiatives struggle not because they are difficult to build, but because the underlying problem was never clearly framed. By the time delivery begins, assumptions have already hardened, scope has narrowed prematurely, and important trade-offs have been made implicitly rather than deliberately.</p>
<p>This page describes how I approach problem framing and discovery, not as a phase to rush through, but as the work that determines whether everything that follows will remain coherent over time.</p>
<h3>Why problem framing matters</h3>
<p>When a problem is framed too late, teams inherit constraints they did not choose. Delivery becomes reactive, architecture becomes defensive, and systems accumulate complexity that feels unavoidable but is often self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Effective framing creates space to:</p>
<ul>
<li>distinguish symptoms from root causes</li>
<li>surface hidden assumptions early</li>
<li>understand who bears the cost of getting it wrong</li>
<li>identify decisions that will be difficult to unwind later</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is quiet, but its absence is usually felt months or years down the line.</p>
<h3>What discovery is and what it is not</h3>
<p>Discovery is not a requirements gathering exercise, and it is not a design sprint aimed at producing solutions quickly.</p>
<p>Instead, discovery focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the problem space before narrowing it</li>
<li>mapping constraints, incentives, and risks</li>
<li>identifying where clarity already exists and where it does not</li>
<li>determining what must remain stable as everything else changes</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcome is not a specification, but a shared understanding of intent.</p>
<h3>Working with ambiguity</h3>
<p>In complex environments, ambiguity is unavoidable. The goal is not to eliminate it prematurely, but to work with it deliberately.</p>
<p>During discovery, I help stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow down decision-making at the right moments</li>
<li>resist the pull of familiar solutions</li>
<li>make trade-offs explicit rather than accidental</li>
<li>agree on what not to solve yet</li>
</ul>
<p>This often feels counter-intuitive in delivery-driven cultures, but it is where the most leverage usually sits.</p>
<h3>Typical outputs of discovery</h3>
<p>While discovery is primarily about understanding, it does produce concrete artefacts that support later work. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>problem statements and boundaries</li>
<li>architectural options and implications</li>
<li>risk surfaces and decision points</li>
<li>areas requiring further validation</li>
<li>signals that indicate when it is safe to proceed</li>
</ul>
<p>These outputs are deliberately lightweight. Their purpose is clarity, not completeness.</p>
<h3>How this fits into broader engagements</h3>
<p>Problem framing and discovery often precede longer engagements, but they can also stand alone.</p>
<p>In some cases, the result of discovery is a clear path forward. In others, it reveals that a proposed initiative should be reshaped, delayed, or stopped altogether.</p>
<p>In all cases, the aim is the same. To ensure that subsequent delivery effort is spent in service of the right problem, rather than compensating for early uncertainty.</p>
