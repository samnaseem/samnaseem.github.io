  <h1>Technical Debt Resolution &amp; Platform Migration</h1>
  <p class="lead">Methodical zero downtime migration from legacy systems to modern platforms</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Every long lived system accumulates technical debt. Some of it is deliberate and well understood. Much of it is not. Over time, this debt compounds: systems become harder to change, more expensive to maintain, and increasingly fragile under load or during change.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Legacy monolithic systems often carry years of accumulated decisions, workarounds, and undocumented dependencies. The organisations that rely on them face rising maintenance cost with diminishing return, inability to adopt new capabilities without disproportionate effort, growing risk of failure with each change, difficulty attracting and retaining technical talent, and fear of migration because the cost of getting it wrong feels unbearable.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I specialise in long term technical debt resolution. This means working with older monolithic systems and migrating them methodically to newer platforms such as microservices, while ensuring maximum uptime throughout.</p>
<p>I am meticulous about ensuring nothing goes down. This comes from years of experience managing high stakes, zero downtime transitions where failure is not an option. The approach involves mapping the full dependency landscape before anything moves, decomposing monoliths into bounded migratable units, running old and new systems in parallel during transition, validating each stage before proceeding to the next, and using CI/CD pipelines to maintain continuous delivery throughout the migration.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This work is most relevant when systems are business critical and cannot afford downtime, when previous migration attempts have stalled or been abandoned, when the technical debt has reached the point where change is more expensive than it should be, or when the organisation needs to modernise but cannot accept the risk of a big bang replacement.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>Systems become maintainable again. The cost of change decreases. New capabilities become possible without heroic effort. And the organisation moves from a position of fragility to one of confidence, knowing that the platform beneath them is designed for the next decade rather than held together from the last one.</p>
