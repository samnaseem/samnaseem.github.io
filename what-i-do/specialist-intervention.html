  <h1>Complex Ad Hoc Situations &amp; Capability Gaps</h1>
  <p class="lead">Stepping in where internal capacity lacks the knowledge for a complex situation</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Not every problem fits neatly into an existing team's expertise. Some situations arise that are genuinely unprecedented for the organisation: unfamiliar technology, an unusual combination of constraints, a problem that spans domains in ways nobody anticipated.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Internal teams are built around known, recurring needs. When something falls outside that scope, the organisation faces a gap, not in effort or willingness, but in specific knowledge and experience. Common symptoms include a problem that has been escalated multiple times without resolution, a technical situation that nobody on the team has encountered before, a need for deep expertise in a technology or domain the organisation does not normally work with, a complex integration or migration that requires judgement beyond the current team's experience, and a time critical situation where learning on the job is not a viable option.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I step in to provide the senior architectural judgement needed to navigate these situations with clarity and confidence. This is not about replacing the internal team. It is about augmenting their capability at the specific point where the gap exists.</p>
<p>I assess the situation quickly, identify the critical path, make the judgement calls that unblock progress, and ensure the internal team understands what was done and why so they can maintain the result independently.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This applies when the internal team is stuck on something genuinely beyond their experience, when time pressure makes it impractical to build the necessary knowledge internally, when the situation is complex enough that getting it wrong would be expensive, or when leadership needs confidence that the right decisions are being made in unfamiliar territory.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>The blockage clears. The internal team gains both a resolution and an understanding of how it was reached. The organisation builds confidence that complex, ad hoc situations can be handled without panic. And critically, the knowledge transfer that occurs during the intervention leaves the team better equipped for next time.</p>
