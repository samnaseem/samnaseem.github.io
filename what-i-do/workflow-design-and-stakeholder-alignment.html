</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>The gap between what a system can do and what people actually need it to do is where most operational frustration lives. Software is often built to satisfy a specification rather than to serve the people who use it every day.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Operational pain points tend to accumulate quietly. Teams develop workarounds, export data into spreadsheets, maintain shadow processes, and absorb inefficiency as normal. Over time, the gap between the system and the work widens. Productivity suffers. Satisfaction drops. And nobody can agree on what the actual problem is because everyone experiences it differently.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I begin by understanding the specific operational pain points from the perspective of the people who experience them. Not from a requirements document, but from direct observation and conversation.</p>
<p>From there, I devise simple, effective interfaces with the necessary workflows to increase productivity and operating satisfaction while enhancing and adding functionality. The emphasis is on simplicity: the best workflow is the one that feels obvious in hindsight.</p>
<p>Critically, I proactively engage with the necessary stakeholders and work with logic, reason, and transparency to ensure everyone is aligned. This is not a design exercise conducted in isolation. It is a collaborative process that builds consensus as it builds software.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This work is most relevant when teams are frustrated with existing tools but cannot articulate exactly why, when multiple departments interact with the same system but have conflicting needs, when previous attempts at improvement have failed because they solved the wrong problem, or when leadership wants to improve operational efficiency but needs someone to bridge the gap between technical possibility and human need.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>People stop fighting their tools and start using them. Manual workarounds are replaced by designed workflows. Stakeholders feel heard and aligned. And the organisation gains not just better software, but better understanding of its own operations.</p>
