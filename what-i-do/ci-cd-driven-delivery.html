  <p class="lead">Using CI/CD as a steering mechanism for maximum value at pace</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are often treated as purely technical practices. In reality, CI/CD is a delivery philosophy: the ability to move fast without breaking things, to adapt direction based on real feedback, and to maintain quality while shipping continuously.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Many organisations struggle with delivery pipelines that are slow, fragile, or disconnected from the actual pace of decision making. Releases are batched into large, risky deployments. Feedback loops are weeks long. And the gap between deciding to change something and seeing that change in production creates friction, risk, and wasted effort.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I use CI/CD as a steering mechanism across all engagements. This means designing production workflows that are dynamically responsive rather than rigidly planned. The pipeline becomes the delivery backbone: every change is tested, validated, and deployable at all times.</p>
<p>This approach ensures that value reaches production at pace, that direction can be adjusted continuously based on real feedback and evolving requirements, that risk is distributed across many small releases rather than concentrated in infrequent large ones, and that the entire team operates with confidence that what they ship will work.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This practice underpins almost everything I do. Whether the engagement involves migration, integration, new development, or operational improvement, CI/CD driven delivery ensures that progress is visible, reversible, and continuous. It is particularly critical in zero downtime migration work, where the ability to deploy, validate, and roll back safely is non negotiable.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>Delivery becomes predictable rather than heroic. Teams ship smaller, safer changes more frequently. Feedback loops tighten from weeks to hours. And the organisation gains the ability to steer rather than just push, adapting direction based on what is actually happening rather than what was planned months ago.</p>
