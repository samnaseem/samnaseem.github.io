  <p class="lead">Rapidly developing automated pipelines when primary systems must go offline</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Sometimes systems need to come down and there is no plan for what happens to the data, transactions, orders, and operational flow that depends on them. The business cannot simply stop. Customers, partners, and internal operations expect continuity regardless of what is happening beneath the surface.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Enterprise systems are frequently interconnected in ways that make it impossible to take one offline without affecting others. When a primary system needs urgent repair, upgrade, or replacement, the organisation faces a flood of incoming data with nowhere to go, orders and transactions that must continue processing, downstream systems that expect upstream data to keep flowing, and users who need the system to appear operational even when it is not.</p>
<p>In many cases, there is no existing fallback. The system was never designed with this scenario in mind, and the internal team does not have a ready solution.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I specialise in rapidly developing automated pipelines that act as a backstop in exactly these situations. The goal is to keep everything seemingly operational to the outside world, absorbing and processing the flow of data, orders, and transactions, while the underlying primary architecture is repaired, replaced, or upgraded beneath it.</p>
<p>This involves understanding the full scope of what the primary system handles, building pipelines that intercept and process the critical flows, ensuring data integrity is maintained throughout the transition, coordinating the cutover back to the primary system once it is ready, and validating that nothing was lost, duplicated, or corrupted during the interim period.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This applies in genuine emergency situations where a system must be taken offline and there is no existing contingency, where a planned migration or upgrade requires a period of parallel operation, where data flow interruption would cause contractual, regulatory, or financial damage, or where the organisation simply cannot afford for the outside world to know something is wrong.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>The organisation gains time. Instead of a crisis where everything stops, there is a controlled period where the backstop pipeline handles continuity while the real work happens underneath. When the primary system comes back, the transition is seamless. And the organisation often retains the backstop architecture as a permanent contingency capability for the future.</p>
