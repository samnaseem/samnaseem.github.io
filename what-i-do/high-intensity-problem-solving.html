  <h1>Attacking Complex Enterprise Problems with Horsepower</h1>
  <p class="lead">Significant technical depth and sustained focus on the hardest problems</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Some problems are not just complex. They are genuinely hard. They resist standard approaches, defy quick fixes, and demand a level of technical depth and sustained focus that most people and most organisations are not willing to commit.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>The hardest enterprise technical problems tend to share certain characteristics. They involve multiple interconnected systems with non obvious dependencies. They have resisted previous attempts at resolution. They require deep understanding across multiple technical domains simultaneously. They demand the patience to work through layers of accumulated complexity before the real issue becomes visible. And they punish superficial solutions that address symptoms without reaching the root cause.</p>
<p>These problems often persist not because nobody has tried, but because nobody has applied sufficient depth for long enough.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I attack these problems with significant horsepower. This means committing the technical depth, sustained focus, and intellectual stamina required to get to the bottom of things properly rather than patching over them.</p>
<p>I am not content to work around complexity or defer to simpler alternatives when the hard problem is the one that actually needs solving. I go deep enough to understand the full picture, identify the real leverage points, and design solutions that resolve the underlying issue rather than managing its symptoms.</p>
<h2>When this applies</h2>
<p>This applies when the organisation has a problem that everyone agrees is important but nobody has been able to solve, when previous approaches have been too shallow or too narrow, when the problem requires someone willing to spend sustained time in genuinely difficult technical territory, or when leadership needs confidence that the hardest problem in their landscape is being addressed with appropriate seriousness.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<p>The problem gets solved. Not worked around, not deferred, not reframed into something easier. Solved. The organisation gains not just a resolution but confidence that their most difficult technical challenges are within reach. And the approach itself, the willingness to go deep rather than wide, often reveals insights and opportunities that were invisible from the surface.</p>
