  <h1>Intelligent Automation</h1>
  <p class="lead">Automation that adapts, decides, and improves rather than just following rules</p>
</div></section>
<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Intelligent automation extends traditional automation beyond fixed rules and predefined workflows. It combines AI capabilities with process automation to handle tasks that require judgement, adaptation, or the ability to work with unstructured information.</p>

<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>Traditional automation follows predetermined rules: if this, then that. Intelligent automation adds the ability to interpret unstructured data (reading documents, understanding emails, processing images), make decisions under uncertainty (classifying, prioritising, routing based on learned patterns), adapt to changing conditions (adjusting behaviour based on new data rather than waiting for a rule change), and handle exceptions intelligently (escalating when confidence is low rather than failing silently).</p>
<p>It is not about replacing people. It is about handling the repetitive, high volume, low judgement work so that people can focus on the tasks that genuinely require human expertise.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Intelligent automation typically combines robotic process automation (RPA) for interacting with existing systems and interfaces, machine learning models for classification, extraction, and decision making, natural language processing for handling text based inputs, workflow orchestration for managing end to end processes, and human in the loop design for handling exceptions and edge cases.</p>
<p>The intelligence comes from the ML and NLP components. The automation comes from the orchestration and integration layers. Together, they can handle processes that are too complex for traditional RPA but too repetitive or high volume for manual handling.</p>

<h2>Where it creates real value</h2>
<p>Intelligent automation is most valuable in high volume, document heavy, or decision intensive processes. Practical examples include invoice processing and accounts payable automation, customer onboarding with document verification, claims processing and initial assessment in insurance, regulatory reporting and compliance checking, IT service management with automated triage and resolution, and supply chain coordination across multiple systems and partners.</p>

<h2>Where it is commonly misapplied</h2>
<p>Intelligent automation fails when the underlying process is broken. Automating a bad process makes it fail faster, not better. It is also misapplied when the expectation is zero human involvement (most processes benefit from human oversight at exception points), when the integration surface is underestimated (connecting to legacy systems is often the hardest part), or when the organisation automates before understanding the process thoroughly.</p>

<h2>How it relates to architectural decisions</h2>
<p>Intelligent automation raises architectural questions about integration architecture (how automated processes connect to existing enterprise systems), orchestration design (how multi step processes are managed, monitored, and recovered when something goes wrong), scalability (handling volume spikes without degradation), human in the loop design (how and when exceptions are escalated, and how human decisions feed back into the system), and governance (who is accountable when an automated process makes a consequential decision).</p>

<h2>How it connects to other disciplines</h2>
<p>Intelligent automation draws on <a href="natural-language-processing.html">NLP</a> for document and text processing, <a href="computer-vision.html">computer vision</a> for visual inspection tasks, <a href="supervised-learning.html">supervised learning</a> for classification and decision support, and <a href="mlops-and-pipelines.html">MLOps</a> for maintaining the models in production. <a href="responsible-ai.html">Responsible AI</a> is essential where automated decisions affect people, finances, or compliance.</p>
