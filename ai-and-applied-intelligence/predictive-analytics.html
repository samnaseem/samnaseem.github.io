<p>Predictive analytics is where machine learning meets business decision making. It is the discipline of using historical data and statistical models to forecast future outcomes, enabling organisations to act before events occur rather than after.</p>

<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics applies statistical and machine learning techniques to historical data to generate forecasts about future events. Unlike reporting (which tells you what happened) or diagnostic analytics (which tells you why it happened), predictive analytics tells you what is likely to happen next.</p>
<p>It is the business application layer that sits on top of the core ML disciplines. The models underneath might use supervised learning, time series analysis, or deep learning, but the purpose is always the same: giving decision makers a view of what is coming so they can prepare for it.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The process begins with historical data about the outcomes you want to predict. Models are trained to identify the patterns and relationships that precede those outcomes. Once validated, the models are deployed into operational systems where they generate predictions on live data, often in real time or near real time.</p>
<p>The predictions are then integrated into business processes: dashboards, alerts, automated decisions, or recommendations that help people act on the forecast.</p>

<h2>Where it creates real value</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is most valuable when early action significantly changes the outcome. Practical examples include customer churn prediction (intervening before a customer leaves), demand forecasting (adjusting inventory, staffing, or production in advance), predictive maintenance (servicing equipment before it fails rather than after), credit and risk scoring (assessing likelihood of default or loss), and sales pipeline forecasting (predicting revenue with greater accuracy).</p>
<p>The common thread is that knowing what is coming, even imperfectly, is significantly more valuable than reacting after the fact.</p>

<h2>Where it is commonly misapplied</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is misapplied when predictions are treated as certainties rather than probabilities, when the business process cannot actually act on the prediction quickly enough to change the outcome, when the historical data does not reflect current conditions (the most common source of poor predictions), or when the cost of being wrong is not factored into how predictions are used.</p>

<h2>How it relates to architectural decisions</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics raises architectural questions about real time versus batch prediction (how quickly do forecasts need to reach decision makers), data freshness (predictions based on stale data are worse than no predictions), integration with operational systems (predictions that sit in a dashboard but are not connected to action have limited value), feedback loops (how actual outcomes are captured and used to improve future predictions), and scalability (forecasting across thousands of customers, products, or assets simultaneously).</p>

<h2>How it connects to other disciplines</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is typically built on <a href="supervised-learning.html">supervised learning</a> models, may leverage <a href="deep-learning.html">deep learning</a> for complex pattern recognition, and depends on <a href="mlops-and-pipelines.html">MLOps</a> for reliable production deployment. <a href="unsupervised-learning.html">Unsupervised learning</a> often informs predictive analytics by identifying the segments or features that predictions should focus on.</p>
