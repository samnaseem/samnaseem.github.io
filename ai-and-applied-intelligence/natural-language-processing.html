<section class="content"><div class="content-inner">

<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is the discipline that allows machines to work with human language, whether that is reading documents, understanding customer messages, extracting information from contracts, or generating written content. It is one of the most commercially mature AI disciplines and one of the most immediately useful in enterprise settings.</p>

<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>NLP covers the full spectrum of language tasks: understanding what text means (comprehension), extracting specific information from unstructured text (extraction), classifying documents or messages by topic, intent, or sentiment (classification), translating between languages, summarising long documents, and generating new text.</p>
<p>At its core, NLP bridges the gap between how humans communicate and how systems process information. Most enterprise data is unstructured text, which makes NLP one of the highest leverage AI disciplines for organisations sitting on large volumes of documents, communications, and records.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Modern NLP is overwhelmingly powered by large language models, neural networks trained on vast quantities of text that learn the statistical patterns of language. These models can be fine tuned for specific tasks (such as classifying legal clauses or extracting product specifications) or used as general purpose tools that respond to natural language instructions.</p>
<p>Earlier NLP techniques such as rule based extraction, keyword matching, and statistical models are still relevant for simpler, well defined tasks where the overhead of a large model is not justified.</p>

<h2>Where it creates real value</h2>
<p>NLP creates value wherever humans currently spend time reading, writing, classifying, or searching through text. Practical examples include automating document review and information extraction, routing and prioritising customer communications, analysing sentiment across feedback, reviews, or social channels, searching and retrieving information from large document repositories, generating drafts, summaries, or reports from structured data, and compliance monitoring across communications and contracts.</p>

<h2>Where it is commonly misapplied</h2>
<p>NLP is misapplied when the expectation is perfect comprehension. Language models are sophisticated pattern matchers, not reasoning engines. They can produce confident, fluent output that is factually wrong. They struggle with nuance, ambiguity, and domain specific terminology unless properly calibrated.</p>
<p>They are also misapplied when deployed without human oversight in high stakes contexts (legal, medical, financial), when the training data does not reflect the language patterns of the target domain, or when the organisation lacks the infrastructure to monitor and correct model behaviour over time.</p>

<h2>How it relates to architectural decisions</h2>
<p>NLP introduces architectural decisions around model hosting (large language models have significant compute requirements), data privacy (text data often contains sensitive information), integration design (how NLP outputs feed into downstream systems and workflows), and cost management (API based language models can become expensive at scale). The choice between hosted third party models and self hosted alternatives is a significant architectural decision with implications for privacy, control, cost, and latency.</p>

<h2>How it connects to other disciplines</h2>
<p>NLP is built on <a href="deep-learning.html">deep learning</a>, powers much of what is visible in <a href="generative-ai.html">generative AI</a>, and feeds into <a href="intelligent-automation.html">intelligent automation</a> (where language understanding enables more sophisticated process automation). <a href="responsible-ai.html">Responsible AI</a> is particularly relevant to NLP given the risks around bias in language models and the potential for generating misleading content.</p>
