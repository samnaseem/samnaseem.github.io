<p>AI strategy and governance is the discipline that ensures an organisation's use of AI is deliberate, aligned with business objectives, appropriately governed, and sustainable over time. Without it, AI initiatives tend to proliferate without coordination, creating redundancy, risk, and wasted investment.</p>

<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>AI strategy defines where and how an organisation should invest in AI, based on its specific objectives, capabilities, and risk appetite. AI governance establishes the policies, processes, and structures that ensure AI is developed and used responsibly, consistently, and in compliance with relevant regulation.</p>
<p>Together, they answer the questions that individual AI projects cannot answer on their own: which problems should we apply AI to and in what order, how do we build and maintain the capabilities required, what risks are we willing to accept and how do we manage them, who is accountable for AI decisions and their consequences, and how do we ensure compliance as regulation evolves.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>AI strategy typically involves assessing organisational readiness (data maturity, technical capability, cultural alignment), identifying high value use cases aligned with business priorities, defining the target operating model for AI (centralised, federated, or hybrid), planning the capability build (people, platforms, processes), and establishing metrics for measuring AI value and impact.</p>
<p>AI governance establishes the policy framework, approval processes, risk classification, oversight structures, and compliance mechanisms that ensure AI is used appropriately across the organisation.</p>

<h2>Where it creates real value</h2>
<p>AI strategy and governance create value by ensuring AI investment is focused on the highest impact opportunities, preventing the accumulation of ungoverned AI systems that create hidden risk, building organisational capability that compounds over time, reducing duplication (multiple teams solving the same problem independently), ensuring compliance with current and emerging regulation, and building the trust (internal and external) required for AI to be adopted at scale.</p>

<h2>Where it is commonly misapplied</h2>
<p>AI strategy is misapplied when it is treated as a one off exercise that produces a document and is then ignored. Strategy must be a living practice that adapts as the organisation, technology, and regulatory landscape evolve.</p>
<p>AI governance is misapplied when it creates so much friction that teams work around it, when it is disconnected from the people actually building AI systems, or when it focuses exclusively on risk avoidance at the expense of value creation. Effective governance enables responsible progress rather than preventing it.</p>

<h2>How it relates to architectural decisions</h2>
<p>AI strategy and governance have profound architectural implications: platform decisions (shared AI infrastructure versus project specific tooling), data architecture (ensuring data is available, governed, and fit for AI use across the organisation), integration standards (how AI capabilities are exposed and consumed across systems), security architecture (protecting models, data, and predictions), and scalability planning (designing infrastructure that can grow with AI adoption rather than becoming a bottleneck).</p>

<h2>How it connects to other disciplines</h2>
<p>AI strategy and governance sits above and across every other discipline on this page. It determines which disciplines the organisation invests in, how <a href="mlops-and-pipelines.html">MLOps</a> is implemented, how <a href="responsible-ai.html">responsible AI</a> policies are enforced, and how individual capabilities like <a href="predictive-analytics.html">predictive analytics</a>, <a href="generative-ai.html">generative AI</a>, and <a href="intelligent-automation.html">intelligent automation</a> are prioritised, coordinated, and governed as part of a coherent enterprise AI programme.</p>
