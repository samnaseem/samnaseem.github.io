# Access and Introductions

## How access occurs

The Venture Assessment Channel has no open entry.

Access occurs only through:
- personal introduction,
- trusted referral,
- or an existing relationship.

This is intentional.

---

## No open submissions

There is no mechanism to:
- submit ideas,
- send pitch decks,
- request assessment,
- or initiate engagement through this site.

Unsolicited approaches are declined by default.

Silence should not be interpreted as feedback.

---

## Role of introducers

Introductions made through this channel carry implicit responsibility.

Introducers are expected to:
- understand the boundaries of this channel,
- avoid positioning it as a service or opportunity,
- and ensure basic alignment before making contact.

Introductions that bypass these expectations may not proceed.

---

## Pre-engagement requirement

No substantive discussion occurs without a pre-engagement agreement in place.

This agreement exists to:
- protect intellectual contribution,
- define boundaries,
- establish asymmetry explicitly,
- and prevent future disputes.

Surface-level context may be exchanged prior to agreement.  
Assessment does not begin.

---

## What happens after introduction

Following a valid introduction:
- an initial framing conversation may occur,
- key assumptions and risks are surfaced,
- and a decision is made whether to proceed with assessment.

There is no obligation to continue.

A decision not to proceed is a complete outcome.

---

## No persistence, no escalation

Repeated follow-up, escalation through intermediaries, or attempts to reopen a closed decision are not effective.

Decisions are not softened over time.

---

## Why access is constrained

Access is constrained to:
- protect time and attention,
- preserve judgement quality,
- and ensure that assessment remains deliberate rather than reactive.

Constraint is a feature of this channel, not a limitation.

---

## Final note

If access to this channel feels difficult, that is intentional.

It exists to ensure that architectural judgement and long-term responsibility are deployed only where they are justified.

Saying no is the default.  
Saying yes is consequential.
